## Filter Users by Client (Admin)

As an administrator, I want to be able to filter the list of users by their role (freelancer or client) on the users list page, so that I can easily manage and view specific user groups.

**UAT**

Given I am on the users list page in the admin panel. When I select "Client" from the role filter. Then the list should only display users with the "Client" role.
