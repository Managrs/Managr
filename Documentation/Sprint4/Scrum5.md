## Search Users by Name or Email (Admin)

As an administrator, I want to be able to search for users by their name or email address on the users list page, so that I can quickly find specific users.

**Search by Name Test Case**

Given I am on the users list page in the admin panel. When I enter a user's full name or partial name in the search field and submit the search. Then the list should only display users whose names match the search query. The search should be case-insensitive.

**Search by Email Test Case**

Given I am on the users list page in the admin panel. When I enter a user's full email address or partial email address in the search field and submit the search. Then the list should only display users whose email addresses match the search query. The search should be case-insensitive.
