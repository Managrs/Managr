# Objectives

1. Check up / Stand up
2. Discussion of final deployment and merging
   

## Team Status Summary:

1.The team got together and combined their work so everything is ready for the final version of the app.

2.We ran into a problem with Azure — it couldn’t build the app properly because of an issue with the main.ts file. We're still figuring it out, but we have a temporary fix so we can still show the app for now.

3.All the main features are working and have been added to the main codebase.

4.We're getting ready to show the app to the client. We already did a practice run of the demo with the internal team.

### Key Points Raised:

1.Final merge review was completed collaboratively, reducing conflicts and improving deployment readiness.

2.Azure issue may require DevOps follow-up; a potential config mismatch is suspected.

3.Confidence remains high in the demo version being ready for tomorrow’s Sprint Review and client presentation.
