1. Check up / Stand up

## Check up / Stand up

Group members had to explain what work they have done and explain why some of the work was missing. 

A new Organization repo had to be created for the project on github to ensure that we work in a centralized manner and we can track the progress. The previous repo belonged to a single user making is difficult to manage.

Azure was setup for Deployment and linked to the repo. A dummy site was deployed to test if Azure is correctly [linked](https://red-flower-021f5d510.6.azurestaticapps.net/ "The Azure Site").
